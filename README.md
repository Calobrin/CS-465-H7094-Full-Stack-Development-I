# CS-465-H7094-Full-Stack-Development-I
This is the repository that I will be using for my CS-465 course at SNHU. Unlike other courses where the repository was added at the end, this was made at the beginning.

# I WILL FINISH THIS LATER

# Architecture
# Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
# Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

# Functionality
# How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
# Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user # interface (UI) components.

# Testing
# Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. 
# Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

# Reflection
# How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more 
# marketable candidate in your career field?
